## 🏆 Challenges Overcome

### Technical:
- **Git Bash navigation issues** → Switched to GitHub Desktop
- **Missing 'public' keyword in main methods** → Fixed after code review
- **Logic bug in LargestOfThree** → Debugged and corrected
- **Folder sorting issue** → Documented, will use leading zeros from Day 2

### Personal:
- **Fear of going public** → Chose transparency over hiding
- **Privacy concerns** → Strategic setup with delayed education details
- **Commitment anxiety** → Made public promise for accountability

## 📝 Key Lessons Learned

1. **Focus on goals, not obstacles** - When Git Bash failed, found alternative
2. **Code review is invaluable** - Caught bugs I didn't notice
3. **Starting is the hardest part** - Day 1 complete, momentum building
4. **Transparency creates accountability** - Public journey = commitment
5. **Strategic thinking matters** - Planning ahead (AI in Month 4) shows maturity
6. **Adaptation > Stubbornness** - Switch tools when needed
7. **Ask for help** - Questions are strength, not weakness

## 💭 Reflection

Day 1 was hard. Setup always is.

But the difference between those who succeed and those who don't?

**The ones who succeed don't quit on Day 1.**

They adapt when stuck.  
They ask for help.  
They keep moving forward.  

That's what I did today.

**Status:** Day 1 complete. 179 more to go.

**The difference between dreaming and achieving?**  
**Starting TODAY. Not stopping TOMORROW.** 🔥
